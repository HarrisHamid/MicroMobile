# MicroMobile
For students who live off campus, getting to and from campus can end up being a hassle. Especially considering not all of us have the space and or spare change for a mode of transportation. That's where MicroMobile comes in. Our rental platform makes it easy for students to rent or list micro mobility vehicles such as bikes, scooters, skateboards, and more on a flexible hourly or daily basis. Whether you’re heading to class, getting food, or looking for a faster way to get around, our app provides an accessible solution. 

As students, we are usually on a tight schedule and budget. Our app will provide a cost effective, eco-friendly, and convenient way to travel around campus and Hoboken. By creating a peer-to-peer rental system, we create a community driven solution that benefits both the renters and owners.
